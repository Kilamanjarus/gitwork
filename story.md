This is a short story about a cat named mocha. She is currently attacking my ankles and moewing to the heavens begging for her daily lunch. She just had a hairball 10 minutes ago. She is persistent. She is now back meowing to the heavens. Beyond that, she tends to sleep most of the day away until it is time for bed, then she is back to being a terror. She's a pretty old cat at 15, very little to no health problems.
